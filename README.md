# Rules

A home-planting game is a great concept for a quick, 15-minute multiplayer session. To keep it fast-paced and competitive, we’ll focus on a **"Resource Race"** mechanic where players compete to fill their virtual apartment with the most valuable plants.

Here are the rules for **"Windowbox Wars."**

## 🏠 Windowbox Wars: The Rules

### 1. Objective

Score the most **Bloom Points** by successfully growing and harvesting plants within 15 minutes.

### 2. Player Roles & Setup

* **Players:** 2–4 players.
* **Starting Kit:** Each player starts with 3 empty pots, 1 watering can (unlimited water), and 50 "Seed Credits."
* **The Shop:** A shared central market that refreshes every 60 seconds with random seeds and fertilizers.

### 3. Core Gameplay Loop

Players must manage three main variables for every plant:

* **Hydration:** Plants lose water over time. If the meter hits zero, the plant wilts and stops growing.
* **Sunlight:** Players must drag their pots to different windows (North, South, East, West) as the "sun" moves across the screen during the 15-minute round.
* **Pests:** Occasionally, "Aphids" will appear on a plant. Players must click them away or use a "Ladybug Power-up."

### 4. Plant Varieties

To add strategy, use different plant "tiers":

| Plant Type | Grow Time | Difficulty | Points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Succulent** | 2 min | Low (Needs little water) | 10 pts |
| **Sunflower** | 5 min | Medium (Needs constant sun) | 40 pts |
| **Ghost Orchid** | 8 min | High (Needs precise care) | 120 pts |

## ⚡ Multiplayer Mechanics (The "Chaos" Factor)

Since it’s multiplayer, players can interact with each other to gain an edge:

* **Trade Market:** Players can post seeds for sale to other players if the Shop is out of stock.
* **The "Pollination" Bonus:** If two players grow the same flower type at the same time, they both get a 1.5x growth speed boost.
* **Sabotage (Optional):** A "Cloudy Day" card can be bought to block the sun for an opponent for 30 seconds.

## ⏱️ The 15-Minute Timeline

* **0:00–2:00 (The Sprout):** Fast-paced buying and planting of basic seeds.
* **2:00–12:00 (The Growth):** Managing multiple pots, shifting plants for sunlight, and dealing with random pest outbreaks.
* **12:00–14:00 (The Bloom):** High-tier plants begin to finish. Players must decide whether to sell for points or risk one last quick-grow crop.
* **14:00–15:00 (The Harvest):** The "Golden Hour"—all growth speeds are doubled, and points are tallied.

### Why this works

This structure creates a "stressful cozy" vibe. It’s easy to understand, but the moving sun and the ticking clock force players to prioritize which plants deserve their attention.
